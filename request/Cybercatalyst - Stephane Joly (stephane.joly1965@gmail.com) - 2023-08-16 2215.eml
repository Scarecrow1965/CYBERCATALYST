Almost all organizations rely on efficiently organized computer networks to
accomplish day=E2=80=90to=E2=80=90day business. Computer network architects=
 design those
networks, and computer systems engineers run them. Computer systems
engineers implement the network architects=E2=80=99 designs, and solve the =
complex
problems involved in the day=E2=80=90to=E2=80=90day operations of networks.=
 They frequently
test system operations, identify security risks, and research new products
or processes that will improve system function. Network architects need to
be effective leaders, and both roles require strong communication and
teamwork skills.
